Simplified iOS projet that based off of clean architecture. This is a naive solution cause I don't know swift/iOS development. I'm just trying to map my current knowledge to iOS.

- [Concept] [iOS] - [Android Counterpart]
- [Rendering] SwiftUI - Compose
- [Network] Alamofire - OkHttp
- [Async Handling] Promise - Coroutine
- [Dependency Injection] AppContext - Dagger/Koin/etc. (AppContext is no where near the level of dagger but it is a form of DI)
